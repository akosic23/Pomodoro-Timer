# Pomodoro-Timer
Created a React App Utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The user can alter the duration of the times and there is an audio triggering the change between focus and break times.
